Division of Work

We split up coding responsibilities mostly as the specification suggested. Jacky handled getmem, as well as checkheap and getmemstats, and Hunter handled freemem, as well as the benchmarking program and printheap. We independently developed pseudocode and algorithms for each of the programs we were responsible for, and coded initial versions of the programs independently. Then we spent the rest of the time running our code, debugging and cleaning up together while looking at the code at the same time.
